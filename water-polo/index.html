which the objective is to get the football sized ball into the opponents
net. It is a challenging but also highly rewarding sport combining
speed, strength, action, teamwork and a high level of fitness, meaning
it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to get fit and have fun!</p><p>Water polo at Warwick offers not only competition and training at the
highest university level, but also a fantastic social team atmosphere
for players of all levels of ability. From players competing in the
British National League and European semi-professionals who trained in
the youth divisions of the world&rsquo;s best clubs to complete novices who
never held a water polo ball before joining, we are a diverse group
united by our strong bond to our sport and team.</p><p>With 3 polo training sessions a week planned by our head coach Robert
Smee, as well as access to multiple coached swimming sessions and
strength and conditioning workshops we have everything in place for you
to develop to your potential and for our team to continue competing at
the top division in our area for BUCS.</p><p>Despite competing at a high level, beginners represent an integral part
of our club with many of our members never having played before
university. New players can gain match experience throughout the year
through friendlies with other university or local teams, although there
is always an opportunity for even complete beginners to earn a place on
our 1st teams! Our training sessions are also split into groups of
different experience and ability to even allow beginners not interested
in competing to train in a relaxed and fun atmosphere.</p><p>If you have any questions please contact us through the details on this
website or just find us on Facebook (WUFF - University of Warwick Swimming and Water Polo Club) or
just drop-by at any training session.</p><p>We look forward to seeing you in the pool!</p><hr><section class="hero has-background-light testimonial"><div class=hero-body><div class="container is-max-desktop"><p class=subtitle><span class="font-bold has-text-link is-size-5">&#8220; </span>I joined women‚Äôs waterpolo on a whim and I could not be more thankful for the great friendships I have made here! My advice to incoming freshers is to show up and you will surprise yourself! The great thing about women‚Äôs waterpolo is all skill levels are welcome and you have the ability to learn so much. I came to the UK not knowing a single person and I am so happy I took the chance to try waterpolo and make Warwick feel like home ‚ù§<span class="font-bold has-text-link is-size-5">

water polo session he was hooked! He joined the team and made his debut at age 13, progressing through the club and through to the GB squads. After a break he decided to come back as a coach and has trained GB‚Äôs Junior Women‚Äôs team as they prepared for the 2020+1 Junior European Champs. He now coaches both of our water polo teams with enthusiasm and dedication!</p></div><div class=column><img src=/img/waterpolo_coach.jpg alt></div></div><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently asked questions</h2><details><summary>Is there a minimum number of sessions I need to attend each week?</summary><p>We have no set expectations for attendance‚Äîwe understand that you are all
hard working students and will often have timetable clashes, so cannot make
every session. What we do ask is that you attend all sessions that you can
and are fit for, and that you try your best at every session.</p><p>With our new status as performance sport silver there is an expectation for
our first teams and scholarship athletes to maintain high attendance.</p></details><details><summary>What do I need to bring to sessions?</summary><p>Everyone must have a bottle of water with them at every session, our
training can be extremely strenuous! For people with long hair, you need to
have a cap. Suitable water polo attire if you own it, but if not, we will
try to source you one to use for matches. Goggles are advisable as we can
sometimes have swim sets. (Side note: Do not bring/wear any jewellery during
training and matches, and ensure you are nails are short-we run the risk of
hurting each other otherwise!).</p></details><details><summary>Who coaches the session?</summary><p>We have our very own water polo coach called Rob, he is a brand new addition
to the team as of 2020! He has coached Team GB's Junior Women's Water Polo
team and was a Team GB standard player himself. We look forward to working
with him throughout the season. Captains will also be present to coach
alongside our coach and will also be leading sessions when the coach is not
present.</p></details><details><summary>Which competitions do we enter as a club?</summary><p>For both men's and women's, we have a BUCS 1st team which will be competing
throughout the first and second term. The men's first team also participate
in the local Warwickshire league. We also have relaxed game play friendlies
against other unis that we can host and participate in so there is lots of
opportunity to get match play in!</p></details><details><summary>Do I have to compete?</summary><p>If you do not want to compete we will not force you. As we have 2 BUCS teams
(women's & men's), there is less pressure if you want to slowly learn the
pace of the game.</p></details><details><summary>What is the selection procedure for the competitive squads?</summary><p>This is currently under review but it will be a fluid process. Teams are not
set in stone.</p></details><section class="section is-small"><div class="content container is-max-desktop"><div class="columns is-vcentered"><div class=column><img src=/img/swimmer.webp alt class=shadow></div><div class="column has-text-centered"><h1 class=title>üèä ü§Ω</h1><p>Whether you are new to swimming or water polo, or looking to perfect
