## Meet the coaches

### Dr. Josh Patel (Head Coach)

Josh is back as coach (we don't know why he has not left already, this
is his eighth year at uni) after a two year sabbatical from the role.
Josh is a PhD student studying History, and if you hear him mumbling
something about _'personal development'_ and _'employability'_ whilst he's
trying to correct your freestyle catch it is best to leave him to it,
he is desperate to be relevant so he can get an academic job, bless him.
He is also very thankful he was offered the job as it means he can have
hot dinners this winter.

### Ollie Smith-Machancoses (Development Officer)
