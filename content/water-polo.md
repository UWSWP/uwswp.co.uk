Water polo is a seven-a-side team sport played in a swimming pool in
which the objective is to get the football sized ball into the opponents
net. It is a challenging but also highly rewarding sport combining
speed, strength, action, teamwork and a high level of fitness, meaning
it's a fantastic way to get fit and have fun!

Water polo at Warwick offers not only competition and training at the
highest university level, but also a fantastic social team atmosphere
for players of all levels of ability. From players competing in the
British National League and European semi-professionals who trained in
the youth divisions of the world's best clubs to complete novices who
never held a water polo ball before joining, we are a diverse group
united by our strong bond to our sport and team.

With 3 polo training sessions a week planned by our head coach Robert
Smee, as well as access to multiple coached swimming sessions and
strength and conditioning workshops we have everything in place for you
to develop to your potential and for our team to continue competing at
the top division in our area for BUCS.

Despite competing at a high level, beginners represent an integral part
of our club with many of our members never having played before
university. New players can gain match experience throughout the year
through friendlies with other university or local teams, although there
is always an opportunity for even complete beginners to earn a place on 
our 1st teams! Our training sessions are also split into groups of
different experience and ability to even allow beginners not interested
in competing to train in a relaxed and fun atmosphere.

If you have any questions please contact us through the details on this
website or just find us on Facebook (WUFF - University of Warwick Swimming and Water Polo Club) or
just drop-by at any training session.

We look forward to seeing you in the pool!

{{< testimonial name="Riley" message="I joined women’s waterpolo on a whim and I could not be more thankful for the great friendships I have made here! My advice to incoming freshers is to show up and you will surprise yourself! The great thing about women’s waterpolo is all skill levels are welcome and you have the ability to learn so much. I came to the UK not knowing a single person and I am so happy I took the chance to try waterpolo and make Warwick feel like home ❤" squad="Women's Water Polo Member" img="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18099289/183516376-c214b25b-e821-4bf1-8881-dce1b688a966.png" >}}
