hard working students and will often have timetable clashes, so cannot make
every session. What we do ask is that you attend all sessions that you can
and are fit for, and that you try your best at every session.</p><p>With our new status as performance sport silver there is an expectation for
our first teams and scholarship athletes to maintain high attendance.</p></details><details><summary>What do I need to bring to sessions?</summary><p>Everyone must have a bottle of water with them at every session, our
training can be extremely strenuous! For people with long hair, you need to
have a cap. Suitable water polo attire if you own it, but if not, we will
try to source you one to use for matches. Goggles are advisable as we can
sometimes have swim sets. (Side note: Do not bring/wear any jewellery during
training and matches, and ensure you are nails are short-we run the risk of
hurting each other otherwise!).</p></details><details><summary>Who coaches the session?</summary><p>We have our very own water polo coach called Rob, he is a brand new addition
to the team as of 2020! He has coached Team GB's Junior Women's Water Polo
team and was a Team GB standard player himself. We look forward to working
with him throughout the season. Captains will also be present to coach
alongside our coach and will also be leading sessions when the coach is not
present.</p></details><details><summary>Which competitions do we enter as a club?</summary><p>For both men's and women's, we have a BUCS 1st team which will be competing
throughout the first and second term. The men's first team also participate
in the local Warwickshire league. We also have relaxed game play friendlies
against other unis that we can host and participate in so there is lots of
opportunity to get match play in!</p></details><details><summary>Do I have to compete?</summary><p>If you do not want to compete we will not force you. As we have 2 BUCS teams
(women's & men's), there is less pressure if you want to slowly learn the
pace of the game.</p></details><details><summary>What is the selection procedure for the competitive squads?</summary><p>This is currently under review but it will be a fluid process. Teams are not
set in stone.</p></details><h2 id=meet-the-exec>Meet the exec</h2><p>This year&rsquo;s exec is a wonderful bunch of enthusiastic, not to mention good looking, people who want to make your experience at UWSWP as awesome as it can possibly be.
