    Heya, I'm Maddy and I am a 2nd year Law student. Quick fact file on me:
    I have been swimming practically my whole life and have competed at a
    multiple times at a national level. Development squad is a great
    alternative to club swimming, especially for swimmers who feel less
    confident in their abilities or simply want to come along for the social
    aspect. Joining the development side of the club is a great way to get
    involved without as much pressure. Dev have 5 training times a week, but
    it completely up to you what kind of dedication you put into it. We
    heartily encourage those swimmers with higher competence to try out Club
    and even Waterpolo. Or you could mix and match! You will find that UWSWP
    has an amazingly supportive atmosphere and that myself and the other
    exec/coaches are there only to help and bolster you lot.
